# Builds a release bundle without needing the EGS version.
#
# Downloads the latest upstream release bundle (which provides a prebuilt
# c-api1 and the prebuilt DLLs the .NET components compile against), rebuilds
# whichever components your toolchain can build, overlays them onto the bundle,
# and zips the result. Optionally publishes it.
#
# Any component that fails to build (e.g. a missing toolchain) is kept from the
# upstream release. c-api1 is only rebuilt if you pass both -SteamDir and
# -EgsDir, because building it launches each game version to scrape its native
# API; without them it is kept from upstream like any other un-buildable
# component.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/package-release.ps1
#   ./scripts/package-release.ps1 -SteamDir "C:\...\Steam game" -EgsDir "C:\...\EGS game"
#   ./scripts/package-release.ps1 -Tag v0.5.1 -PublishRepo <owner>/<repo> -Publish
#
# Requires: dotnet, gh (authenticated). Run from anywhere in the repo.
